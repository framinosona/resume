# SlowMove - Microsoft ImagineCup 2014 Winner

**SlowMove** was our winning project for Microsoft ImagineCup 2014, earning the **1st National Innovation Prize** in France. This innovative video editing application used advanced frame-interpolation algorithms to create smooth slow-motion effects from regular video footage.

## Project Overview

### The Challenge

Traditional slow-motion video requires recording at high frame rates, which wasn't widely available on consumer devices in 2014. We wanted to democratize slow-motion video creation by enabling users to transform any regular video into smooth slow-motion footage.

### Our Solution

SlowMove used cutting-edge frame interpolation algorithms to analyze motion between frames and generate intermediate frames, creating smooth slow-motion effects from standard 30fps video.

## Technical Implementation

- **Intermediate Frame Generation**: AI-powered frame synthesis between existing frames
- **Quality Optimization**: Multiple interpolation methods for different video types
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of slow-motion effects during editing

### User Interface

- **Intuitive Timeline**: Drag-and-drop interface for selecting slow-motion segments
- **Effect Customization**: Variable slow-motion speeds and smoothing options
- **Export Options**: Multiple output formats and quality settings
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple videos with saved effect presets
